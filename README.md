ICEBERG COLLISION - 2D Graphics Simulation
This project, ICEBERG COLLISION, is a 2D graphical simulation representing a river scene where the impact of an iceberg is visually depicted. Developed using OpenGL, this interactive application provides an engaging graphical interface for users, showcasing the fundamental concepts of computer graphics, such as rendering, transformations, and event handling.

About the Project
The project utilizes the OpenGL API to render a dynamic 2D environment, complete with animations and interactive features. Users can interact with the simulation using keyboard events, enabling them to control the display and toggle between day and night modes for a more immersive experience.

Features
Dynamic Scene Rendering:

Simulates a river view with an animated iceberg collision effect.
Realistic representation of the scene with smooth transitions and visual effects.
Interactive User Control:

Keyboard inputs to start or abort the simulation.
Toggle between day and night modes for varying visual perspectives.
OpenGL Functionality:

Utilizes geometric primitives (points, lines, polygons) for rendering objects.
Implements transformations like rotation, scaling, and translations for scene dynamics.
Incorporates lighting and texturing to enhance realism.
About OpenGL
OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) is a powerful, cross-platform API used for rendering 2D and 3D graphics. This project leverages OpenGL's state machine and graphics pipeline to process geometric primitives, handle transformations, and render images onto the frame buffer.

Key OpenGL Features in the Project
Geometric Primitives: Construction of graphical objects using points, lines, and polygons.
Transformations: Implementation of 3D transformations such as scaling, rotation, and translations for interactive scene updates.
Lighting and Materials: Realistic rendering through lighting effects and material property adjustments.
Texture Mapping: Integration of pixel-based primitives for enhanced visual appeal.
Project Highlights
Scene Interaction: The user can interactively control the simulation, making it both educational and engaging.
